Build a Python Cyber Security - Phishing Link Scanner

Here’s the flow:

Install necessary libraries.
Define functions to check for suspicious patterns, domain information, known phishing links, and page content.
Combine these functions into a main scanning function that checks the URL for phishing signs.
Test the scanner by inputting URLs and analyzing them.
Now, when you run this notebook, you’ll be able to enter URLs and check if they seem safe or possibly phishing attempts!
